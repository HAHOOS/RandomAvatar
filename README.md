# Random Avatar

Have you ever had a situation where you were not sure what avatar to choose? Well, this mod comes to your rescue. With this, you can press a single button in BoneMenu and change into a random avatar.
If you really want to make your game perhaps more fun, consider using the option that changes your avatar with a set interval. Yes, you've heard that right! You can also change your avatar to a random one when you die.

## Features

- Switching to a random avatar (obviously)
- Cool effect when changing the avatar which can be turned off or on
- Switching your avatar to a random one with a set interval (for example, every 30 seconds)
- Changing into redacted avatars, if you really really want to, you can turn on an option to include redacted avatars.

## Planned

- Switching avatar on level change
- Blacklisting/whitelisting avatar groups
